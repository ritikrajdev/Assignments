## Guidelines
Keep Naming Consistent.
* Top Level Directory must be Space Seperated and named as `Major - Degree` (e.g `Computer Science - BE`)
* All directories under `Major - Degree` must be named as `Sem <Sem-Number>` (e.g `Sem 1`)
* All directories under `Major - Degree/Sem <Sem-Number>` must be named as the subject code (e.g `UCS531`)
* All directories/files under `Major - Degree/Sem <Sem-Number>/<Subject Code>` must follow same convention (of your language choice).
* In case of Same Subject Code / Assignments previously uploaded, add a `symbolic link / hard link / Shortcut` to the previously done assignment.
